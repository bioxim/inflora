In InFlora, rewards are designed to be fair, sustainable, and tied directly to player engagement and productivity. The system encourages participation, long-term strategy, and reinvestment within the ecosystem.

### 💼 Work-based Rewards

Players earn $FLORA based on the type of "work unit" or "project" they activate. Each job offers different levels of investment and return:

- **Miners** receive the highest yield but require significant upfront investment.
- Other professions like **farmers**, **lenders**, and **merchants** generate steady income streams with varying degrees of risk and involvement.
- Productivity is tied to tool quality, project level, and time commitment.

### 🌾 Yield Over Time

Projects generate $FLORA gradually rather than instantly. This time-based mechanism discourages pump-and-dump behavior and supports steady ecosystem growth. Players are rewarded for staying active and consistent in their roles.

### 🔁 Reinvestment Cycle

A key part of the game economy is reinvestment. Players can use earned tokens to:

- Upgrade tools or unlock higher-level projects.
- Purchase additional work units.
- Stake for passive income.
- Participate in new governance proposals.

This cyclical flow increases engagement and reduces unnecessary withdrawals, helping control inflation.

### 🧱 Staking & Passive Rewards

Players who wish to support the ecosystem long-term can stake $FLORA in exchange for passive rewards or influence in governance. Staking also serves as a mechanism to support the in-game "Central Bank" (liquidity provider), which ensures the stability of the economy.

### 🎖️ Reputation and Ranks

As players progress and reinvest in the game, they may unlock new reputation levels or ranks. These can grant access to exclusive tools, better projects, and even enhanced earning multipliers, rewarding loyalty and strategy.

### 🧠 Token Engineering

The $FLORA token is designed to be more than a simple in-game currency — it is the backbone of the InFlora economy and infrastructure. 

To ensure a seamless player experience and financial transparency, $FLORA will be fully launched and listed **before** the game becomes fully operational. Players will **enter the game using $FLORA** directly, not by purchasing it within the game.

#### 🌐 Multichain Availability

$FLORA will be initially available on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains to enhance accessibility and liquidity. The primary chains under consideration include:

- Ethereum
- Base
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- Polygon

This multi-chain approach allows users to bridge and interact with the ecosystem from their preferred networks.

#### ⛏️ Mining Mechanics

- **Max Supply**: 100,000,000,000,000,000 $FLORA  
- **Token Distribution**: All tokens will be distributed through mining, ensuring fair and decentralized access.
- **Mining Hubs**: Each player can operate a “mining room” with up to **100 mining slots**.
- **Scaling**: Mining efficiency can be increased by upgrading the room or acquiring new mining equipment.
- **Progression**: As players level up, they unlock more powerful roles and increased mining rates.

This mechanism makes **miners the founding participants** of the ecosystem and aligns early investment with long-term engagement.

#### 📈 Staking & APY Model

Players can stake their $FLORA in the game’s Central Treasury — which functions like a decentralized bank — in return for passive rewards.

### 📊 APY Calculation

To ensure fairness and sustainability, $FLORA uses a dynamic staking reward model based on market performance. This mechanism prevents unnecessary token inflation and encourages long-term holding during market downturns.

#### 🔁 Daily Formula:

**_APY = (Average Price over 365 days - Yesterday's Price) / 365_**

- ✅ If the result is **positive** → rewards are distributed that day.
- ❌ If the result is **zero or negative** → APY = 0%, and **no rewards are paid** that day.

#### 💡 Why this matters:
This system ensures that staking rewards:
- 💸 **Encourage loyalty** when the token is undervalued.
- 🚫 **Avoid inflation** when the token is already performing well.
- 🔒 Create a more **sustainable economy** aligned with actual market trends.

> 🧠 Example:  
> If the 365-day average price of $FLORA is $0.0040 and yesterday’s price was $0.0035,  
> the daily APY would be:  
> `(0.0040 - 0.0035) / 365 = 0.00000137 → 0.000137%`  
> This rate compounds over time if the token remains below the average.
