description: Learn how $FLORA is mined, distributed, and kept inflation-free through a sustainable model.
---

The $FLORA token follows a carefully designed emission model that avoids inflation while rewarding early supporters and long-term players. All tokens are distributed through virtual mining ‚Äî there is **no pre-minted allocation**. The only way to earn tokens is through active participation in the game.

### üå± Mining & Distribution

Mining is the foundation of the InFlora economy. Players who choose the **"Miner"** path are the ones responsible for generating $FLORA through their in-game mining setups.

Key characteristics of the mining system:

- **Max Supply**: 100,000,000,000,000,000 $FLORA  
- **Block Reward**: A fixed number of $FLORA per block (to be defined)  
- **Mining Rate**: Blocks are generated at a consistent rate over time  
- **Mining Hubs**: Each miner can build one mining room with **100 spaces**  
- **Upgradeable**: Mining efficiency can be improved through upgrades  
- **Exclusive Role**: Mining is the most expensive job to access in-game, making it exclusive and investment-focused  
- **Multirole Access**: Players can also take on additional roles (e.g. farmers, lenders, merchants)

Mining is not only a way to earn, but also a core element in distributing governance power. Founders and early investors are encouraged to take this role to support long-term growth.

### üîÅ Sustainability Model

InFlora introduces a **circular economy** where every token used in-game has a purpose:

- Tokens are spent to **activate roles**, **upgrade tools**, and **trade**.
- There is **no infinite emission** ‚Äî once the supply is exhausted, players must rely on circulating tokens.
- This creates **natural scarcity**, encouraging responsible use and fostering value.
- **No centralized minting or burning** ‚Äî all supply dynamics are community-driven.

This sustainable model ensures that $FLORA retains its value over time, avoids hyperinflation, and promotes healthy economic growth within the game.
