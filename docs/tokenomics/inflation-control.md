InFlora is designed with sustainability and transparency in mind üå±. To avoid the most common pitfalls of crypto ecosystems‚Äîespecially inflation‚Äîour economy is based on a **single token model** with built-in mechanisms to ensure stability and long-term growth.

### Single Token System

The $FLORA token is the **only currency** within the game. All in-game activities, purchases, earnings, and upgrades are priced and paid in $FLORA. However, when a player decides to withdraw funds from the game, the value is **exchanged into a stablecoin** (such as USDC) to provide price stability and confidence.

### The InFlora Central Bank üè¶

When players withdraw their in-game profits, a central treasury, called the **InFlora Bank**, acts as the **liquidity provider**. The USDC (or chosen stablecoin) used for withdrawals comes from this pool, and the corresponding $FLORA tokens are either:
- **Staked** to continue generating passive rewards,
- **Burned**, or
- **Held** for ecosystem maintenance, future development, and team compensation.

All funds and balances held in the InFlora Bank are **fully transparent** and accessible to users for verification.

### Burn & Fee Mechanisms üî•üí∞

To ensure a deflationary pressure over time and reduce excess token circulation:
- Every **purchase or upgrade** made in-game carries a **burn fee**. This portion of the token is sent to a burn wallet and removed from supply permanently.
- An **additional transaction fee** is charged and redirected to the InFlora Bank for liquidity, ecosystem rewards, and operational costs.

These mechanisms create a **sustainable token economy**, preventing hyperinflation while also reinvesting into the growth of the ecosystem.

Through careful design, InFlora ensures that economic value stays within the system, balancing player incentives, operational funding, and token scarcity.
