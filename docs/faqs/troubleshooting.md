# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

## 😕 I can't connect my wallet

- Make sure you're using a supported wallet (like Backpack or Phantom)  
- Check if you're on a supported network (Base, Solana, BNB)  
- Reload the app and try reconnecting

## 🧩 I selected a role but nothing happens

- Wait a few seconds, the blockchain transaction might still be processing  
- Ensure you’ve confirmed the transaction in your wallet  
- Check your balance — you may not have enough $FLORA

---

## 🧾 My marketplace purchase didn’t go through

- Check your transaction status in the block explorer  
- Verify that your wallet is properly funded  
- If the transaction failed, your $FLORA was not burned

## 🔒 I lost access to my account!

Unfortunately, we can’t recover wallets.  
Make sure you **safely store your seed phrase** and never share it with anyone.
