# 🗳️ Voting Mechanism

InFlora empowers its community by ensuring **each user has an equal voice** in major decisions. Here's how voting works:

## 🧾 1. Proposals

- Any user can submit a proposal via the governance dashboard.
- Proposals can include:
  - 🌱 Feature improvements
  - 🔄 Game balancing
  - 🧩 New job roles or mechanics
  - 💰 Treasury spending

## ⏳ 2. Voting Window

- Each proposal is open for **72 hours** (3 days).
- Players can vote: ✅ **Yes**, ❌ **No**, or 💤 **Abstain**.
- Voting is transparent and viewable on-chain.

## 🧮 3. Results

- A proposal is **accepted** if:
  - 🟢 It reaches at least **60% Yes votes**, AND
  - 👥 Minimum **20% of total users** participate.
- If not, the proposal is marked as rejected or sent back for revision.

## ⚖️ Fairness Rules

- 🗂️ Each user gets **1 vote** — no matter their investment, level, or time in the game.
- 🔄 Voting power does **not accumulate** or stack.
- 👮‍♀️ Any form of manipulation or duplicate accounts will result in ban penalties.

## 📌 Final Notes

- Votes and outcomes are **public and immutable**, secured via smart contracts.
- In special cases, emergency proposals may be submitted with **shorter durations**.

> 🎯 The goal of voting in InFlora is to build a fair, inclusive, and player-driven world where everyone contributes to its evolution.
