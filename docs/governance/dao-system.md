# 🏛️ DAO System

InFlora is governed by a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** structure that ensures transparency, democracy, and community-driven decision-making.

## 🔍 Purpose of the DAO

The DAO exists to:

- ✅ Ensure transparency across all game-related processes
- ✅ Facilitate voting on important decisions
- ✅ Manage treasury funds and reserve allocations
- ✅ Oversee future project upgrades or forks

## 🔐 How it Works

Each player is granted **1 vote** upon registration, regardless of role, investment, or status. Votes are used to decide on:

- New project or role additions
- Balancing and economic changes
- Seasonal events or promotions
- Community suggestions or proposals

All proposals and results are **public and on-chain**, fostering trust and decentralized accountability.

## 💼 Treasury Management

The DAO treasury is responsible for:

- Receiving transaction fees (excluding token burns)
- Allocating funds for development and rewards
- Managing staking and liquidity reserves
- Funding special events and community incentives

The treasury is managed by **smart contracts**, with no central authority.
