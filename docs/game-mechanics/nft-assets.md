## What Are NFT Assets? 🌱

InFlora includes **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** that represent unique in-game assets. These NFTs are blockchain-based and owned by players, allowing full transparency, tradability, and future utility.

## Types of NFT Assets 🎒

Here are the core types of NFTs in InFlora:

| Type            | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌾 Lands         | Each project/role starts with a unique land plot. Expandable and upgradeable. |
| 🛠️ Tools         | Starter kits and upgradeable items used for job tasks.      |
| 🏗️ Buildings     | Structures that provide bonuses (e.g., factories, silos).   |

## Utility of NFTs 💼

- **Ownership**: Players truly own their assets. They can sell or trade them.
- **Gameplay Advantage**: Higher-level tools or lands provide better yields.
- **Collectibles**: Some NFTs may be rare or seasonal.
- **Upgrade Path**: Many assets can be upgraded and improved.

---

## Interoperability 🔗

NFTs will be minted and stored on supported blockchains (e.g., **Solana**, **Polygon**, **BNB Chain**, **Ronin**). This allows players to **bridge and use them across ecosystems** in the future.

---

## Future Use Cases 🔮

- **Renting NFTs** to other players
- **Cross-role items** for hybrid strategies
- **Crafting NFTs** using other NFTs + $FLORA
- **Skinning & personalization** of avatars and lands

---

## Economic Role 🧮

NFTs add long-term value and uniqueness to each player's journey. By giving utility to the NFTs in gameplay and limiting their issuance, we ensure that:

- **Assets gain value over time** through scarcity and utility
- **Secondary market dynamics** boost engagement and strategy
- **Player retention increases**, especially for collectors and strategists
