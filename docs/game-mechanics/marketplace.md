description: The in-game market for buying and selling user-generated goods using $FLORA.

## Overview 🧾

The **Marketplace** is the core exchange hub of the InFlora economy. Players can buy and sell goods produced on their lands, using $FLORA as the exclusive currency. The marketplace is open to all users, regardless of their role, but operates under strict decentralized rules to ensure fairness and sustainability.

---

## What Can Be Bought or Sold? 🔄

Only **products generated in lands** (such as crops, livestock, timber, minerals, etc.) can be listed and traded.  
Additionally, only players with the **Booster role** are allowed to craft items that **upgrade player levels**, which are also tradable in the marketplace.

---

## Who Administers the Marketplace? 👨‍⚖️

The marketplace is **decentralized and rule-based**. All transactions must go through the public market — players **cannot self-deal**, meaning a user with multiple roles cannot sell directly to themselves.  

You, as the developer/operator, will define the **pricing algorithms and fee structure** at launch. Over time, a governance system may allow community voting to adjust these parameters.

---

## Fees & Token Burn 🔥💰

- All purchases in the marketplace are paid in $FLORA.
- **100% of $FLORA used** to buy items will be **burned**, reducing token supply.
- However, a **small transaction fee** (percentage TBD) will be **redirected to the Central Bank**, which:
  - Sustains the ecosystem,
  - Funds staking rewards,
  - And generates revenue for the developer/operator.

## Auctions or Fixed Prices? 🧃

At launch, the system will support **fixed pricing only**.

In the future, **event-based auctions** or limited-time offers could be introduced to enhance liquidity and add gamified economic strategies.

---

## Economic Impact 📉📈

The marketplace acts as a **deflationary engine** for $FLORA. Since tokens used in trades are burned, the circulating supply decreases over time, helping to combat inflation.  
By requiring all users to use the marketplace (no peer-to-peer trades allowed), the game maintains economic transparency, and prevents closed-loop resource hoarding.  

The fee redirected to the Central Bank ensures that liquidity and staking incentives remain sustainable, creating a **healthy token sink and feedback loop**.
