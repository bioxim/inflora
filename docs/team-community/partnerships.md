# 🤝 Partnerships

InFlora is designed as a **multichain, modular ecosystem**, open to integration and collaboration with other projects, tools, and protocols.

## 🌐 Vision for Partnerships

We’re looking to collaborate with:

- Blockchain protocols (Base, Solana, Ronin, BNB Chain)
- NFT marketplaces & tooling
- Stablecoin liquidity providers (e.g., USDC)
- Web3 analytics or data platforms
- DeFi staking platforms

## 🤝 What We Offer

- A growing user base with daily interactions
- Opportunities for token use and utility in-game
- On-chain economy with real governance
- Unique mechanics for staking and DAO integration

## 🚀 Launch & Collaboration Timeline

Partnerships will be announced post-token listing and smart contract deployment.
