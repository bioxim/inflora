# 🌱 Founder

InFlora was created by a solo founder — a passionate builder, thinker, and gamer — with a vision to revolutionize crypto gaming 🎮🌿

## 👤 Who?

An anonymous but deeply engaged developer with a background in:

- 🧠 Data science
- 💻 Blockchain (Solana, Base, BNB Chain, Ronin)
- 🎨 Creative design & gameplay systems
- ⚖️ Tokenomics & sustainability

> With ChatGPT as a co-pilot 🤖 — the documentation, tokenomics, and strategy were shaped as a duo. Kind of like a web3 buddy system 💚

## 🎯 Why?

To solve common problems in crypto:
- Inflation without real value ❌
- Overpowered whales controlling governance 🐋
- Projects with no true utility 🚫

## 💡 Vision

A fun, transparent, and **self-sustaining simulation game** where **time + effort = real reward**.

> The founder believes in community over hype, utility over speculation, and fun over FOMO.
