## Overview

**InFlora** is a decentralized simulation game that merges economic strategy with virtual productivity. All game interactions and transactions are conducted exclusively with the native token **$FLORA**.

Players start by selecting a role and joining a project, which grants them access to a **starter land** and a **basic toolkit**. These can be **expanded** and **upgraded** through gameplay.

Each player contributes to the ecosystem by producing valuable in-game products, which are traded in the **player-driven marketplace**. These products are essential for other players to **progress, improve tools, expand lands**, and unlock advanced features within the game.

## Key Game Concepts

- 🎮 **Project Entry**: Players pay with $FLORA to access a project (e.g., mining, farming, lending).
- 🌱 **Land Ownership**: Each project comes with a piece of land that can be upgraded to increase productivity.
- 🧰 **Starter Kit**: Each project includes tools specific to the role, which can also be upgraded.
- 🔁 **Game Loop**: Work → Produce → Sell/Trade → Upgrade → Expand.

All game mechanics are designed to create a **self-sustaining circular economy** powered entirely by $FLORA.

## Tech Note

All logic runs on-chain, and progression states are validated via smart contracts. Only players who contribute meaningfully to the economy can access advanced features, creating a **merit-based structure** that rewards strategy, reinvestment, and collaboration.
