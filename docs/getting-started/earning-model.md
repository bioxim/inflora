# Earning Model

InFlora's earning model is designed to create a sustainable and engaging in-game economy where players generate value through participation, production, and trade.

## Revenue Sources

Players can earn $FLORA through the following mechanisms:

- **Production**: Completing activities within their projects (e.g., mining, farming, lending) generates products or tokens.
- **Marketplace Trading**: Selling produced goods or assets (tools, upgrades, etc.) to other players.
- **Role Specialization**: Some roles enable earning through services provided to other players (e.g., loans, transport, crafting).
- **Asset Management**: Upgrading and expanding land or tools increases output and potential revenue.
- **Reinvestment**: Using earnings to improve their operations leads to greater long-term yield.

## Withdrawal System

While all transactions within the game are in $FLORA, players may convert their earnings outside the game. The withdrawal system operates via:

- **Bank Central**: A central in-game entity managing liquidity and facilitating stablecoin withdrawals (e.g., USDC).
- **Transparency**: All bank operations are on-chain and visible for verification.
- **Sustainability**: A portion of all in-game purchases and marketplace fees goes to the liquidity pool to maintain a stable economy.
