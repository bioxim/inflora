## Supported Blockchains

InFlora is designed to be a multichain experience, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the game on multiple blockchain networks. This approach ensures accessibility, scalability, and decentralization.

### Initial Supported Networks

At launch, InFlora will support the following blockchains:

- **Solana**: Chosen for its low transaction fees, high throughput, and developer-friendly ecosystem.
- **Base**: Leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 scaling, Base provides low-cost transactions with strong security guarantees.
- **BNB Chain**: Known for its low gas fees and large user base, ideal for expanding the game's reach within DeFi and GameFi communities.
- **Ronin**: A gaming-focused blockchain built for scalability and ultra-low fees, making it a natural choice for high-volume player interactions.
- **Polygon** (Planned): Offers Ethereum compatibility and an active gaming ecosystem.

### Interoperability and Bridging

All in-game transactions will be conducted using the $FLORA token, which will be deployed natively on each supported chain. A secure cross-chain bridge will enable players to transfer $FLORA between networks without friction, while preserving decentralization.

### On-chain Advantages

- Transparent and verifiable ownership of assets (lands, tools, NFTs).
- On-chain progress tracking, identity, and inventory.
- Non-custodial gameplay: Players retain full control of their assets and earnings.
- Broad ecosystem compatibility to drive adoption and liquidity.
