# 🌱 User Progression

InFlora features a layered progression system that empowers users to evolve from basic participants to highly specialized producers and entrepreneurs within the ecosystem. Growth is driven by strategic investments, role selection, and project development. 💼📈

## 🧩 Core Structure

Each user begins by selecting a **Job Role** 🧑‍🌾🧑‍🔧, which determines the type of project they can initiate. These projects serve as income-generating micro-economies and can be expanded or upgraded over time.

### 🏗️ Initial Setup

Upon entering a project, the player pays in $FLORA 💰 to receive:

- 🏞️ **Land Unit** – A foundational space where production occurs.
- 🧰 **Starter Kit** – Includes tools or items necessary for the role's initial productivity.
- 🗳️ **1 Voting Power** – Every player receives exactly one (1) vote, regardless of their role or level. This vote grants participation in community decision-making processes, such as feature upgrades, new inclusions, or ecosystem-wide changes.

Both land and tools have limited capabilities at first but can be upgraded to increase efficiency, yield, and capacity. 🚜🔧

## 📦 Upgrade & Expansion System

Players can expand and improve their operations through:

- 🧱 **Land Expansion** – Unlock more space or increase production capacity.
- ⚙️ **Tool Upgrades** – Improve durability, output speed, or quality.
- 🔓 **Project Levels** – Achieve milestones that unlock new items or productivity features.

Each upgrade requires $FLORA 💸, and sometimes, resources from other players, fostering healthy marketplace dynamics. 🛒🔄

## 🚀 Role Evolution

Users may progress to more advanced roles by:

- Accumulating enough $FLORA 💹
- Meeting performance goals (e.g. products sold, project level)
- Acquiring special NFTs or items 🔐🎖️

## 🧠 Strategic Pathways

Players can tailor their gameplay through:

- 🎯 **Specialization** – Focus on maximizing a single role.
- 🌐 **Diversification** – Join multiple roles to expand capabilities.
- 🤝 **Collaboration** – Trade and co-build with other players for mutual benefits.
