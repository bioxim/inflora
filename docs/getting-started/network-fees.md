## Network Fees

InFlora is designed to be accessible and cost-efficient. To ensure a seamless player experience, the only moments where network fees are applied are during **asset upgrades** and **expansion actions** within the game.

### When Are Fees Applied?

- ðŸ”§ **Upgrading Tools**: Improving the performance or level of a player's toolkit requires a small network fee.
- ðŸŒ± **Expanding Land**: Acquiring additional slots or upgrading existing land incurs a fee.

These fees are necessary to process blockchain transactions, maintain the integrity of ownership, and ensure that upgrades are securely recorded on-chain.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** No network fees are charged during basic gameplay actions such as collecting, crafting, producing, or trading.

### How Are Fees Paid?

All fees are paid **exclusively in $FLORA**, the native token of the InFlora ecosystem. This ensures internal economic consistency and helps reinforce token utility.

In summary, players are only charged network fees at key progression milestones, while enjoying a fee-free experience during regular gameplay. This balance supports both scalability and player engagement.
