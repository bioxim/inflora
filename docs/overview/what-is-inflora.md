> _InFlora is a blockchain-based simulation game with its own economy and governance token used for all in-game transactions._

**InFlora** is a blockchain-based simulation game that mirrors real-life dynamics with a strong focus on economic participation. At the heart of the game lies a self-sustaining economy powered by its own governance token, which players will use for all in-game transactions.

Whether it's trading, upgrading assets, performing tasks, or participating in community decisions, the governance token serves as the primary currency within the ecosystem. InFlora aims to create an engaging, player-driven environment where users can explore, grow, and shape the world togetherâ€”while learning and benefiting from real economic principles.

### Our Vision
To build a decentralized and inclusive simulation game that empowers players to experience, experiment with, and influence a self-sustaining economic world.

### Our Mission
To create an engaging and educational gaming experience that promotes collaboration, long-term thinking, and economic literacy through gameplay rooted in real-world principles.
